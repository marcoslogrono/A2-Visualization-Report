			<p><strong>Dataset:</strong> "Corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates in Boston neighborhoods, 2004-2024"</p>

			<p>This dataset consists of corporate ownership rates and owner occupancy rates for different neighborhoods of Boston over a 20 year span (2004-2024). 
				The dataset also contains US Census data describing the demographics of each neighborhood. 
				However, it is important to note that the demographic data is not up to date (no change in demographic data from 2004-2024).</p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>How does the number of vacant units compare between the neighborhoods of Boston? </strong> 
					I would like to explore a possible connection between corporate ownership rate and 
					number of vacant units among the different neighborhoods.
				</li>
				<li><strong>How has the corporate ownership rate of housing in Boston changed over the years?</strong>
					I thought of this question while reading "When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord". 
					I am interested to see if the trend described in the article can also be observed in Boston.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Is there a relationship between corporate ownership and owner occupancy rates?</strong>
					This question comes from the idea of "absentee owners", people that buy housing units only for investment purposes. 
					Can we observe a trend in Boston?</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

					We start this analysis by looking at the structure of the data in the chosen dataset. This plot shows the total number of housing units for the different neighborhoods in Boston. 
					I find important to note that in this dataset the number of units remain constant throughout the 2004-2024 year span, so the above figure consists of housing data last updated from 2004. 
					From this plot we can pinpoint the neighborhoods with the least and most number of housing units. Namely, Dorchester stands out as the neighborhood with the most units by a large margin 
					(about twice as many as the next in the list, Roxbury) whereas neighborhoods like Longwood, Chinatown, and South Boston Waterfront are at the bottom of this list.

					Following the observation on the total units per neighborhood, we can the look at the number of vacant units (unoccupied) for each neighborhood in Boston. 
					At the top of the list with the most vacant units are the neighborhoods of Dorchester and Roxbury. We could have expected this result intuitively, as Dorchester and Roxbury are both large, suburban neighborhoods. 
					But, how do these numbers compare when scaled to the total number of units for each neighborhood? A more interesting comparison would be to look at the ratio of vacant to total units, as shown in the following figure.

					For the figure above I calculated the ratio of vacant-to-total housing units for each neighborhood and reported them in terms of percentages. Also, the color scale in this figure represents the gross number of vacant units. 
					This highlights the fact that the neighborhoods with the most vacant units, namely Dorchester and Roxbury, do not necessarily have the largest percentage of vacant units per neighborhood. 
					In fact, South Boston Waterfront and Downtown show the largest percentages of vacant units, even though they were near the bottom of the total units list  (Figure 1).

					We then take a look at the average corporate ownership rate for all neighborhoods in Boston over the 20 year period presented in the data. This plot showcases the reality that corporate and private firms (as defined by the metadata)
					 have taken ownership of many of Boston's housing units. In fact, it can be observed that the corporate ownership in 2024 is approximately four times what it was in 2004. It would be interesting to see if this behavior has been observed throughout 
					 all neighborhoods of Boston or if this is a result of aggregation.

					The figure above shows the increase in corporate ownership rates over the 2004 to 2024 time period for some of the neighborhoods in Boston. Plotting this for all neghborhoods we oberved a significant increase in corporate ownership for all of them, 
					regardless of whether they are more suburban like (Dorchester, Roxbury, Roslindale) or near the city (Downtown, Chinatown, North End). A question that arises when looking at this plot is how does the corporate ownership rates compare between the different 
					neighborhoods in Boston currently in 2024, and we explore this in the following plots.
				</figcaption>

					The figure above shows the corporate ownership rates for all the reported neighborhoods in Boston for the year 2024. Superimposing the values from 2004 in this bar chart shows that the corporate ownership rate dramatically increases for all the neighborhoods. 
					In particular, the highest reported values correspond to densely populated areas like South Boston Waterfront, Fenway, and Downtown, whereas the lowest are for more suburban and farther away places from Downtown like Hyde Park, Roslindale, and West Roxbury.

					Next, we can build a bubble chart to connect corporate ownership rates to the percentage of vacant units calculated from the previous analysis. In the chart above the size of the bubbles corresponds to percentage of vacant units, whereas the color scale is for 
					corporate ownership rate. Interestingly, we can note a correlation between these two variables, as neighborhoods with high percentages of empty units (South Boston Waterfront, Fenway, Downtown) also show higher rates of corporate ownership rates. However, again 
					it is important to note that the number of units in this data is not updated for each year, so we are essentially comparing yearly trends assuming constant number of units. This follows into the next question in this analysis regarding owner occupancy rates, 
					which is a variable that does change over time in the dataset.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/pic8.png" alt="" width="700"/>
				<figcaption>
					Here we plot the average owner occupancy rate (rate of owners that actually live in their units) for all of Boston between the 20 year period. We note that there is an observable decrease in owner occupancy rates over the years, 
					although not as drastic as the increase in corporate ownership. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/pic9.png" alt="" width="700"/>
				<figcaption>
					To obtain a better view for the distribution of owner occupancy rates, we plot this variable for the different neighborhoods in Boston for the year 2024. The neighborhoods at the top of the list (West Roxbury, Roslindale, Hyde Park) 
					are those farther away from the city with high levels of suburbanization. This shows that housing farther away from the city are actually occupied by its owners, while those closer to the city are most likely 
					owned by corporate/private firms and rented for profit.
				</figcaption>

					Lastly, we connect the corporate ownership rates and the owner occupancy rates for each neighborhood through the chart above. The size of the squares correspond to the corporate ownership rate, whereas the ownership occupancy rate is 
					described by the color scale. We can observe a correlation between these two variables, as neighborhoods with higher rates of corporate ownership have lower rates of owner occupancy. This makes sense intuitively - why would corporations 
					and private firms live in the units they own, if they are using them to make a profit through rent or increase their value through absentee ownership? In summary, this plot presents how units closer to the city (with higher demand) are more 
					likely to be owned by corporations and not occupied by the owners, whereas farther away in the suburbs most units are owned and occupied by individuals.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>In this analysis we have identified some correlations between rates of corporate ownership, owner occupancy, and vacant units for neighborhoods in Boston from 2004 to 2024. Particularly, it was shown that neighborhoods with higher percentages 
				of vacant units were more likely to be owned by corporations and private firms, and these tended to be in areas in or adjacent to downtown Boston. Additionally, an inverse relationship between corporate ownership and owner occupancy was identified. 
				Units in suburban neighborhoods are more likely to be owned by individuals that live there, whereas low owner occupancy is observed in corporately owned units near the city. Further analysis with additional datasets might look into how these practices 
				have affected rent prices in Boston and which demographics are most affected.</p>
